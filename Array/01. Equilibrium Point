1. Equilibrium Point

Given an array A of n positive numbers. The task is to find the first Equilibium Point in the array. 
Equilibrium Point in an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it.
Example 1:

Input:
n = 1
A[] = {1}
Output: 1
Explanation:
Since its the only element hence
its the only equilibrium point. 
Example 2:

Input:
n = 5
A[] = {1,3,5,2,2}
Output: 3
Explanation: For second test case 
equilibrium point is at position 3 
as elements before it (1+3) = 
elements after it (2+2).

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

class Solution{
    public:
    int equilibriumPoint(long long a[], int n) {
        
        if(n==1) return 1;
        long long sum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            sum+=a[i];
        }
        int ps=a[0];
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++)
        {
            if(ps==sum-a[i]-ps)
                return i+1;
            else
            {
                ps+=a[i];
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

};
