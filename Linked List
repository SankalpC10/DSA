Linked List is a list of chained nodes. Each node has data and a pointer which point towards next node.
struct Node
{
   int data;
   Node *next;
}

1. Display Linked List
   As vector is initialised in function, first create a vector with int type. As we don't need to modify the elements of linked list, create a new temporary node.
   Node should have data of head.We will initialize pointer while loop function. Using while loop till temp!=NULL.
   In while loop- insert the data of first node in vector and point the location to next element from linked list.
Code:
   vector<int> displayList(Node *head)
  {
    vector<int>v;
    Node*temp=head;
    while(temp!=NULL)
    {
        v.push_back(temp->data);
        temp=temp->next;
    }
    return v;
  }
  
2. Sum The Nodes of Linked List
